## Overview

Manage docker instances with hiera in RHEL/CentOS 7.

## Module Description

Creates systemd services for containers specified in hiera.

## Setup

### What docker affects

This module installs docker 1.3.0 from binary, since CentOS 7 repos provide a very old docker version.

### Beginning with docker

Add the docker class in hiera:
    classes
      - docker

## Usage

Set up docker containers in hiera:
    docker::container:
      apache:
        repository: 'akegata/apache2'
        envs:
          - 'APACHE_USER=apache'
        ports:
          - '8080:80'
        volumes:
          - '/var/www/httpd:/var/www/httpd/'

The following parameters are available:
* repository - Name of the repository on docker hub to use (mandatory)
* envs - Environmental variables (optional)
* ports - Ports to publish to the host (optional)
* volumes - Volumes to bind mount (optional)
* options - Other options to pass to docker run (optional)

## Reference

Contains a single class: docker.
A define called docker::container is created, which can be called through hiera as listed in Usage.

The module copies the following folders onto the system (they are taken from the CentOS 6.5 docker RPM):
* /usr/bin/docker
* /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
* /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.socket
* /etc/bash_completion.d/docker.bash
* /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/syntax/dockerfile.vim
* /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/ftdetect/dockerfile.vim
* /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/doc/dockerfile.txt

Services files are also created in /usr/lib/systemd/system for each container specified.

## Limitations

Only compatible with RHEL/CentOS 7 at this moment.
